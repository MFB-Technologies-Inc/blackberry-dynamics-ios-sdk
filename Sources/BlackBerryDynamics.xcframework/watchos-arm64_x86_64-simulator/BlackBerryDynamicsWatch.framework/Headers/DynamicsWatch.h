/**
 * 
 * @brief BlackBerry Dynamics WatchOS interface to support secure messaging between WatchOS and iOS applications.
 * 
 * This class enables secure communication from a Dynamics app running on WatchOS with a companion Dynamics app running on iOS. 
 * 
 * <h3>Introduction</h3>
 *
 * Use this class from a watchOS app to initiate secure authentication and communication with an iOS companion app. This interface
 * is not required within the iOS app. Instead the companion app should be built with BlackBerry Dynamics and utilize Apple's 
 * WCSession API to perform messaging with the watch.
 * 
 * Prerequisites:
 * - The watchOS app and iOS companion app must be integrated with BlackBerry Dynamics v12.1 or later.
 * - The Apple watch must be paired with the same user's iPhone.
 * - Enterprise policy must permit the use of a wearable device.
 * - The watch must be unlocked and worn on the wrist. 
 * 
 * <h3>Setting Up Secure Communications</h3>
 *
 * Setup and pairing of the watch and companion app is done using <tt>secureCommunicationSession</tt>. When successful, the completion block 
 * <tt>authStatus</tt> will be \ss_true and the WatchCommunicationState changed to <tt>WatchCommunicationReady</tt>. The other states and transitions 
 * are shown in the following diagram. 
 * 
 * \uimage{st06 WatchCommunicationState.png,Diagram of watchCommunicationState for BlackBerry Dynamics WatchOS application}
 *
* <h3>Sending Messages</h3>
 *
 * Once secure communication is setup, use Apple's WCSession object to handle sending and receive messages between the 
 * watchOS and iOS companion app. An example using the 'sendMessage' function and associated 'replyHandler' can be found in the 
 * Dynamics WatchMessenger sample app (see below).
 * 
 * <h3>Handling Messaging Errors</h3>
 *
 * If an error is encountered when sending a message, the replies from the <tt>replyHandler</tt> in WCSessionDelegate session(_:didReceiveMessageData:) 
 * will be in the form of:
 * 
 * @code
 * @{WatchMessageErrorKey:[NSError errorWithDomain:WatchMessageErrorDomain
 *                                            code:WatchMessageErrorNeedsCommunicationSecured 
 *                                        userInfo:@{WatchMessageErrorUserInfoKey:@"Waiting to establish trust."}]}
 * @endcode
 * 
 * The error code in the <tt>NSError</tt> object indicates what the reason is for the error.
 *
 * Possible errors are:
 * - \ref WatchMessageErrorPolicyNotAllowed
 * - \ref WatchMessageErrorNeedsCommunicationSecured
 * - \ref WatchMessageErrorOther
 * 
 * <h3>Sample Application</h3>
 * 
 * Get started using the WatchOS and iOS sample app called 'WatchMessenger' located on BlackBerry's GitHub.
 * 
 * See 
 * <a href="https://github.com/blackberry/BlackBerry-Dynamics-iOS-Samples" target="_blank">BlackBerry Dynamics iOS Samples</a>.
