 *
 * Communication must be secured by running this method prior to sending messages to the watch.

 * whether the Wearable Policy is enabled. Authentication status is available in the authStatus callback.
 * If companion app is unavailable the Watch displays an alert indicating that the companion app cannot be reached.
 * If Wearable Policy is disabled Watch displays an alert indicating that the Policy is disabled and IT Admin should be contacted.
